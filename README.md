# SystemAnalysisAndDesign

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was Ian, a man with a vision to provide a driver education service. Ian wanted a system designed to facilitate this vision; a web-based application that could provide customers with an interface for taking exams, scheduling drivers and cars to assist with road tests, and handle all the business aspects of the company.

# What did you do particularly well?

I believe my diagrams are done correctly and provide the proper level of detail.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

After quite a bit of time in the textbook and with other resources, I still cannot fully explain the difference between functional and nonfunctional requirements.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I went through everything from the interview document step-by-step and made sure everything was included in my work. I treated it as a checklist. It is generally important because if they don't like it, they won't pay for it, or recommend you to other potential clients, etc. There is no reason to do extra work because of not doing it right the first time.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

This course was a pretty good example; collect requirements, make diagrams, write pseudocode, develop code, test, implement. The diagramming portions of the course were particularly helpful.
